        "Customer reviews are one of the main sources of organic feedback that can reflect users' real experiences with Starbucks products and services. With reviews coming from various locations and regions, as a data analyst, you must be able to help managers understand patterns of customer satisfaction and complaints based on review data from various regions, in order to optimize service and product quality and increase Starbucks customer retention.\n",
